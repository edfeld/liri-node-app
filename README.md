# liri-node-app

Use Node with API packages.

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

1. liri.js can accepts one of the following commands:

   * `concert-this`

   * `spotify-this-song`

   * `movie-this`

   * `do-what-it-says`

2. Concert-this
  When a user calls the liri.js file in node with the parameters, "concert-this" with a band name, the liri bot will produce a list of future concerts with the following data items:
  
    *`Venue name`

    *`venue location`

    *`Date of the event in the format: "MM/DD/YYYY"`

    if the user does not enter a band name, liri will default to the band, U2.
